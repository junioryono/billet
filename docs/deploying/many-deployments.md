# Many deployments on one host

Running many separate billet deployments side by side, one control plane each, costs little and needs a few things said out loud. Each deployment keeps its own ledger, identity and fleet: nothing here shares scheduling state between them.

## What one idle control plane costs

MEASUREMENT_PLACEHOLDER

## Connections to PostgreSQL

Many control planes on one PostgreSQL server share its `max_connections`, so add them up. One process of a deployment holds at most the writer, the controller claim's session and its readers, and `server.state.postgres.max_connections` is that total:

```yaml
server:
  state:
    backend: postgres
    postgres:
      dsn_env: BILLET_STATE_DSN
      max_connections: 3
```

The readers get what the writer and the claim leave, up to four, so unset is six. Three is the least a control plane can run on, and a value under it is refused with the arithmetic. `billet check` states what the deployment can hold. A reader nothing has borrowed for a minute closes, so a quiet deployment holds fewer than its limit.

**Beyond that number:** a standby in an active-passive pair is a process of its own and holds its own. An operator command run beside the server opens its own too, for as long as it runs, under the same limit; so does a backup, whose `pg_dump` is one more.

**A transaction-mode pooler cannot carry these.** The claim is a session advisory lock, and the writer's `lock_timeout` and the readers' read-only default are session settings, so a pooler handing a server connection to whoever comes next silently drops the exclusion. Point the DSN at the server, or at a session-mode pool.
